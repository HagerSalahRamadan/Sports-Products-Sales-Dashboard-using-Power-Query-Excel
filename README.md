## **Overview**
 
This project demonstrates how to transform raw sales data into a dynamic dashboard using Power Query in Excel.
This dashboard provides key insights into sales performance, product categories, and country-based revenue distribution.


##### **Hereâ€™s how I did it**:
**ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Importing & Cleaning Data**
I started with three separate datasets :-
    -  âœ” Sales Data â€“ Containing product sales records with country codes.
    -  âœ” Country Data â€“ A reference table mapping country codes to country names.
    -  âœ” Product Data â€“ Listing product details like category, retail price, and standard cost.

Using Power Query, I:
    -  âœ… Imported all three datasets.
    -  âœ… Cleaned inconsistencies (e.g., missing values, incorrect data types).

**ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Merging & Transforming Data**
The key to a functional dashboard is a well-structured dataset. To achieve this, I :-
    -  âœ” Merged Queries â€“ Joined the sales table with country and product tables using common keys (Country Code and Product Name).
    -  âœ” Expanded Data â€“ Added product categories, retail prices, and country names to enrich the dataset.
    -  âœ” Reordered & Renamed Columns â€“ Ensuring clarity and consistency.
    -  âœ” Changed Data Types â€“ Converting revenue and cost columns to numeric formats for accurate calculations.

**ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Creating the Dashboard** :-
    - With clean and structured data, I built a dynamic sales dashboard that showcases :-
       -   ðŸ“Œ Total Revenue, Units Sold, COGS, and Profit Margin at a glance.
       -   ðŸ“Œ Revenue by Product Category, Country, and Month to track trends.
       -   ðŸ“Œ Top 5 Sold Products & Country Sales Performance for strategic insights.


  
## Insights from Charts in this Dashboard:

- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** :-
    -  Total Revenue: $8.8 million
    -  Total Units Sold: 460,544
    -  Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $5.02 million
    -  Profit Margin: 43%

   
- **Slicers**: Filter data by Years and Quarters. 

 - **Insights** :-
   -  A 43% profit margin suggests a good profitability level.
   -  With 460K+ units sold, the company has a solid sales volume.
   -  Revenue by Product Category 
         -   .  Beginner category generates the highest revenue.
         -   .  Advanced, Competition, and Freestyle categories contribute less.

   -  Top 10 Countries by Revenue 
         -   .  United States leads revenue at $1.63M, followed by Germany 
                  ($0.57M) and Japan ($0.37M).
         -   .  Other markets (UK, Spain, Austria) contribute much lower.

   -  Monthly Sales Trend 
         -   . Steady performance until October, then a significant spike in 
                 November & December.
         -   .  Likely seasonal demand increase (holiday sales, Black Friday, 
                  Christmas).
   -  Product Performance
         -   . Fun Fly, Bellen, Carlota, Yanaki, Aspen are top products.
         -   . Sales volume and revenue vary across different products.
  
## Recommendations:

  - âœ… Optimize pricing strategies to maintain or improve profit margins.

  - âœ… Analyze high-revenue vs. low-revenue products to improve product mix.

  - âœ… Expand the Beginner category with new products or variations.

  - âœ… Investigate why Advanced and Competition categories are lagging (pricing, demand, competition).

  - âœ… Double down on marketing in the US to maintain leadership.

  - âœ… Plan inventory and promotions for Q4 well in advance to capitalize on peak demand.

  - âœ… Offer early bird discounts in September-October to extend the sales boost.

  - âœ… Reduce risk by diversifying revenue sources across more countries.

  - âœ… Increase local marketing and partnerships in high-potential markets.
